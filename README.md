# Blexbolex-Combined
Computational Art: Project 1 (Blexbolex Mash-Up)

This is the project that I referenced earlier in my Blexbolex lab (Computational Art: Lab 2).
The man and stop sign were integrated from my classmate Victoria Rund's Blexbolex lab. Part of the requirements
was that the two parts came together somewhat cohesively, so Victoria and I decided to have a shrinking man
come very close to being ran over by my biker.

Within this repository, you will find a demo video attached. Enjoy!
